= Privacy Policy =
Dokan Lite uses [Freemius](https://freemius.com/) SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user’s confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

Freemius SDK **does not collect any data by default**. You will be given a clear ‘opt-in’ form to choose whether or not to share data. If you do not agree, you can simply skip data-sharing altogether. None of your data will be shared without your explicit consent — that is completely optional and up to you to decide.
